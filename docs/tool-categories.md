## üéØ Philosophy Behind Categorization

### **Workflow-Based Organization**

Our categories follow the **LLM development lifecycle** rather than technical specifications. This helps developers find tools based on **what they're trying to accomplish** rather than how tools are implemented internally.

### **User-Centric Approach**

Categories are designed from the **user's perspective**:
- A developer building their first LLM app can follow categories in order
- Experienced developers can jump to specific categories for their needs
- Researchers can focus on evaluation and benchmarking tools

### **Practical Over Theoretical**

We prioritize **practical utility** over academic categories:
- Tools are placed where developers would most likely look for them
- Overlapping categories are okay if it improves discoverability
- Real-world usage patterns inform organization decisions

## üéØ Decision Framework

### **Where to Place a Tool**

When categorizing a new tool, we ask:

1. **Primary Purpose**: What is the tool's main function?
2. **Target User**: Who would primarily use this tool?
3. **Workflow Stage**: Where does it fit in the development process?
4. **User Expectation**: Where would developers likely look for it?

### **Resolving Category Conflicts**

**Tool fits multiple categories**:
- Choose the **primary use case** category
- Mention other applications in the description
- Consider adding to multiple sections if genuinely dual-purpose

**New tool doesn't fit existing categories**:
- Evaluate if it represents a new workflow stage
- Consider if existing categories need refinement
- Discuss with community before creating new categories

### **Category Quality Control**

**Each category should have**:
- **Clear purpose** and scope definition
- **5+ quality tools** to justify existence
- **Distinct value** from other categories
- **Logical placement** in overall workflow
